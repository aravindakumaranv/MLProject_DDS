# Predict hotel booking cancellations

This data-set is based on data obtained here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191
The paper above also provides a detailed description of the columns.

The dataset has extensive information on around 120'000 hotel bookings.
You have a certain degree of freedom in deciding what you want to extract from this data-set.
A possible proposal is the following:
    * A binary classification model to predict whether a booking will be cancelled (column is_cancelled).
      In this case, you should remove columns reservation_status (which would contain 'Cancelled' for cancelled bookings) and reservation_status_date.
    * For cancelled bookings, you could predict how many days in advance the guest cancels (a regression problem).
    * Combining the two above models, you could create a nice decision support tool: given a booking, your tool could tell whether it will be cancelled (or give a probability).
      If you think the booking will be cancelled, you can also predict when this will happen.
      Such a tool could then be used on any given day to check how many of the current reservations are likely to be cancelled and overbook accordingly.

## Highlights

* The data is clean.
* The data has some categorical columns.
* If you predict cancellations, the data is slightly unbalanced: around 36% of reservations are cancelled.

## Recommendations

After performing an initial data exploration, remember to only present in your project report the **interesting** finds, if any.
The presentation of data (via a textual description, tables or plots) should be short and informative.

In evaluating this project I am more interested in your correct application of model selection methodologies than in the performance of your model.

If your model has hyperparameters, I am more interested that your model selection procedure took them into account, even if you only try a few possible values for them.
Hyperparameter selection and model training shall not use all your computing resources for one week, but it should be set up "as if" you had access to a large computational infrastructure.
The only difference should be in the number of hyperparameter configurations evaluated; not in the rigour of the methodology used.

You should choose which classification and/or regression metrics to use (and motivate your choice!).
